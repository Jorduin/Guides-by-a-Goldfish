- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jorduin
- 👀 I've been learning zVM and decided to share the tools I made for myself to help guide me through administrative and installation tasks.
- 🌱 I'm currently working on zVM 7.3 and learning about SUSE.
- 💞️ It is my hope that these guides will provide usable rails for others to get from Point A to Point B, learning via first-hand experience 
      rather than simply reading about a task.
- 📫 Message me here on Git if you have issues, questions, comments or concerns. I will also provide my email if asked.
- ⚡ Fun fact: At the time of writing these guides I had a year or less experience with zVM and previously worked in unrelated fields. I found
      getting information about zVM to be cumbersome as IBM PDFs are neither guides nor manuals but instead an odd ghoulash of the two. This is
      more comprehensive than what I've written but also muddies the water in my opinion for both experienced users as well as new. I hope that
      these simplified guides can serve as instructions, as well as training material for those just looking to learn. 
**IMPORTANT** 
Some commands are more powerful than others and can have devastating results. Please remember to submit those with as much protection as possible.
If you need to edit System Config for example, make a copy and edit the copy. Then replace the active System Config after you've done checks.
If you want to use Define MDISK, do so from a sandbox and preferably *to* a fresh second level OS that is not IPL'd. Without these layers of protection
the possible damage is great.
